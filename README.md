# Ontology-based Automatic Test Question Generation

## Project Overview

This project, conducted by Xia Zekai, a student at the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, Moscow State University, supervised by Aleksei Valerievich Yakushin, investigates the automatic generation of test questions using ontologies. Four distinct generation strategies were compared.

### Objectives

The project aims to explore methods of automatically generating test questions based on ontologies and evaluate the effectiveness of different frameworks by:
- Analyzing the research domain and existing solutions.
- Investigating machine representation models for ontologies.
- Establishing criteria for model quality assessment.
- Practical experimentation and analysis of different models.

## Test Generation Strategies

Four strategies were applied in this project:

- **Strategy 1: RDF Triple Attributes Generation**  
  Simple questions created directly from RDF triples (subject, predicate, object).

- **Strategy 2: SPARQL Query-based Generation**  
  Questions generated from ontology data using SPARQL queries with adjustable complexity.

- **Strategy 3: Template-based Generation**  
  Filling predefined templates with ontology data, considering semantic relations for precise formulations.

- **Strategy 4: LLM (Large Language Model)-based Generation**  
  RDF triples extracted through SPARQL and questions generated by the locally deployed Qwen-7B model, ensuring logical consistency.

## Example of Generated Questions

| Strategy | Example Questions                                                                                          |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | "The capital of Nigeria is ________."                                                                     |
| 2        | "Who is the director of Rockstar (2015 film)? <br>A. V._K._Prakash<br>B. Kevin_Spacey<br>C. Gianfranco_Parolini<br>D. Shirley_and_Dino"                           |
| 3        | "Match the countries with their capitals: France - Paris, Iraq - Baghdad."<br>"The author of Descent into Hell (novel) is ________."<br>"Who is the author of Bertram Cope's Year?"<br>"The author of Death Troopers is John_Dickson_Carr.  ‚òê"                                |
| 4        | " I hold the key to China's past, where emperors once ruled from their Forbidden City. Identify me!<br>A) Beijing <br>B) Shanghai <br>C) Xi'an <br>D) Forbidden City"                    |

## Evaluation Results

The test generation strategies were assessed by several experts with the following summarized results:

| Strategy | Mean Score | Std. Deviation | Characteristics                              |
|----------|------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1        | 3.00       | 1.73           | Simple questions, uniform structure          |
| 2        | 4.00       | 1.73           | More diverse but template-oriented           |
| 3        | 7.67       | 0.58           | High quality, diverse question formulations  |
| 4        | 6.33       | 2.08           | Complex questions with some factual mistakes |

## Conclusions

The template-based strategy (Strategy 3) emerged as the most effective, demonstrating clear expression and rich variety. The combination of ontology templates and LLM models offers the best results overall.
